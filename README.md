# ABOUT

_d3wasm_ is a port of the Doom 3 video game to WebAssembly, with a full WebGL renderer backend.

The goal of _d3wasm_ is to demonstrate the power of WebAssembly, while bringing the idTech4 engine to the web.

A running alpha version of this port have been seen early january 2019 on the web, but it was not yet quite good (very slow, and legacy graphics renderer).

The port is now almost complete and functional, with big performance improvement, a full WebGL renderer backend, and progressive loading/streaming of data.

It is not yet published (still miss bits and pieces to do), but stay tuned for more info, online demonstration, technical speak, and build steps.
